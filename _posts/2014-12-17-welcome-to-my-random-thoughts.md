Hi, I'm Nicholas Watson. I'm a developer and leader. I'm constantly digging in to "tech" in order to deliver products and services. My interests consist of software languages, the internet of things, and big data. I currently serve as Vice President of Technology at [Gleason Technology, Inc.](http://gleasontech.com)
