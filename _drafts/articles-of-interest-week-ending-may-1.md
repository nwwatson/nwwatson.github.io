## [Programming with toys and magic should be relished, not scorned](http://bit.ly/1FylNoC)

Early in my career I was a ColdFusion developer. The company I was working at was a defense contractor where many of the projects were written in either Java or C#. My team's focus was building Web based applications such as event registrations, content management systems, social networks and file sharing solutions. Each of our systems stored data in a relational database, required 99% uptime and required tight security. I remember one day, a peer walked in to my cube and asked "When are you going to ditch ColdFusion, stop being a "web developer" and work on real software with Java". The real software he/she was writting was Java Web application running on Tomcat that took a zip file, unzipped it, pulled out an XML file, and ensured that the XML file was valid with an XSD. ColdFusion may not have had the magic of RoR, but I can easily relate to this article. Just because it isn't Java or C# doesn't mean it isn't a "real application" or isn't "real programming".
