<p>We are in the the middle of adding push notificaitons to our mobile application
and started to look at available push notification services. We took a look
at all the usual suspects such as Amazon SMS, Parse and Pusher. One service
that intrigued us with Ionic Push Notifications, because our application is
written using the Ionic Framework.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In order to test things out, we created a simple gem that would allow us to
send push notifications using the service. <a href="https://github.com/nwwatson/ionic_push">IonicPush</a> is a Ruby gem that provides
a simple to use interface with Ionic.ioâ€™s Push Notification service. Work on this
is on-going, however the current version available works completely.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Add the following to your Gemfile and bundle install</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem 'ionic_push', github: 'nwwatson/ionic_push', branch: 'master'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Run the Rails generator to install the initializer in to your Rails project.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle exec rails g ionic_push:install
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Configure the ionic_push.rb file within config/initializers. You can view the environment
variables that are there, or change them for someting else.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping It Up</h2>

<p>Our experience so far has been really positive. Ionic Push Notifications were simple to integrate
<a href="http://docs.ionic.io/v1.0/docs/push-from-scratch">by following their online documentation</a>.</p>
