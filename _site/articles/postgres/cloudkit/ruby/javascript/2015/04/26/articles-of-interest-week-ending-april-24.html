<p>I like to share articles with my team that I find interesting. This weeks articles of interest include a CloudKit introduction, managing large data sets in PostgreSQL, news on Rails 5, and basics that all developers should know about JavaScript.</p>

<p>One of the largest problems for developers is keeping their applications fast and available in the face of
large data sets. Many automatically look for NoSQL solutions to solve the problem tradinging data integrity and ACID compliance for speed. While NoSQL solutions have there place, its good to know how to tune your current
relational database. This quick little article does that, explainging table table inheritance and table spaces.</p>

<p>When Apple released CloudKit and Swift at WWDC 2014, I was intregued. From a distant view, it look as though Apple lowered the cost of entry for building cloud connected systems. Now, I realize that CloudKit, and the use of Apple’s cloud services is only available within its own ecosystem, which is a severe limitation if you need to build for iOS and another platform. However, in my minimal time I have spent with Swift, I’ve liked it. Building something with CloudKit is a goal for me, and this article just might be the start.</p>

<h2 id="why-rails-5--turbolinks-30--action-cable-matter-and-why-dhh-was-right-all-along"><a href="http://bit.ly/1FpKeV6">Why Rails 5 / Turbolinks 3.0 / Action Cable matter, and why @dhh was right all along</a></h2>

<p>This article gets a lot right. The advent of the JavaScript single page application has drastically complicated web development. While I have written single page applications, I can’t say that I enjoy it. It doesn’t matter if its Angular, Ember or Backbone, it adds additional complexity that makes building applications take more time. The additional time and cost associated with these applications means that its going to take you longer to get your product to market. What I loved about Rails is the ability to build web applications fast. I’m glad that the team takes ease of use seriously. I also can’t wait to see web sockets and web api baked in.</p>
