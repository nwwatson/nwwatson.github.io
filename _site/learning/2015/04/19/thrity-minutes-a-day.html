    				<p>One of the most important things that a software developer can do is to continuously
learn. Learning can happen “on the job”, through experimentation, or reading and
interacting with others in the community. Today, I want to talk about reading and
interacting with others in the community.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Here’s how most developers work; they encounter a problem on the job and immediately
reach out to google for a solution. The first person who
has a solution that “fixes” their problem wins. The issue with this approach is
that you don’t know if the solution you’ve chosen is the best solution for your situation.
What do you have to compare it to? Why did you select it? Is there a better
solution out there?</p>

<p>In order to combat this, I’ve encouraged my team members to take the first 30
minutes of each day to learn. This can be done through blogs, newsletters, or news
readers such as FlipBoard and Zite. Lets break this in to a quick process which
occurs daily.</p>

<p><strong>Choose topics that interest you.</strong> Focus on the things you like doing and discover
new techniques, open source libraries or tools that can help you. Take the time to
compare what you currently do to what the author recommends. Is their way better?
Can you improve the author’s technique? Can you contribute anything?</p>

<p><strong>Identify something your weak at, and find sources to help you.</strong> Everyone has a
weakness. Maybe you struggle with relational databases, or you just don’t understand
why anyone would want to use a graph database. Choose a topic that you feel that you
need to understand better and read up on it daily.</p>

<p><strong>Share what you’ve read with co-workers.</strong> Sharing is an important part of the learning
process. By sharing, you’ll gain other vantage points on a particular issue. You will
 also be able to learn if others around you have similar interests or have complimentary
 interests. If you’re the only developer, join local groups or connect on social networks
 with others.</p>

<p><strong>Put it to practice.</strong> Put your new found skills to practice, but be carefully not to
insert your new skill or technique in an area which will ultimately have a negative
impact on your work. Its always nice to find a awesome new library, but having too
many awesome new libraries in your project will ultimately cause clutter and lead to
poor code quality.</p>

<p><strong>Contribute back.</strong> Have you found a better way to solve a problem? Have you modified
someone else’s technique for use in your daily work? Contribute it back using the
blogs comments, or blog about it yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Learning is continuous.</strong> Don’t just be a Googler, searching aimlessly for solutions.
Take the time to learn emerging technologies, understand their costs and benefits, and
grow your knowledge so that the next time you encounter a problem you are less likely to
go to Google and more likely to solve the problem yourself.</p>
